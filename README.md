## Description

The goal of this application is to build a program to allow users to modify a text editor, the contents of which will be saved to a NoSQL database when the user is online, and any changes the user makes while offline will immediatly be uploaded to the database when the internet connection is re-established.

## Usage

This application is a text-editor that can be used both online and offline, whose contents will be saved to a database.

## What I did

I finished a program to allow users to use the text editor both online and offline, as well as to upload any changes made offline to the database once an internet connection is re-established

## What I learned

I learned about PWAs and how they can be used to store data, even when the user is offline.
